### Prototype Pattern to Create Clone Troopers
We are all familiar with the iconic storm troopers from the Star Wars franchise, and I will be creating my very own clones with the help of the Prototype Pattern. Prototype is a creational design pattern that allows us to create new objects by copying an existing object. I decided to have two types of clones, a regular soldier who only fights, and a medic soldier who fights and has first aid skills.

Here is a diagram:
